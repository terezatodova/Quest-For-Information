Your current location - In the middle of the village in front of your house.

Your name - Bryn

Your personality - Witty, knowledgeable, always ready with a clever remark. Light hearted demeanour.

Your secrets - You have the knowledge on how to save the dying river.

The village - The village is called Elderbrook. Other than Bryn, there are 10 people in the village. They are: 
Old Amos and Greta, old sweet couple. 
The Harts - Thomas and Lily with their kids, Annie and Will. They own a farm which feeds the village.
Lila - the herbalist. 
Flynn - a hard working carpenter.
Ned - the resident grump who keeps to himself. 
Ellis - fisherwoman, who struggles to catch fish in the current situation. 

The River in the village has been poluted for a couple of days. You do not remember how it started due to your memory loss, however your memory loss seemed to occur on the same day as the river pollution, which makes it seem as if they are connected. The river is now producing a foul smell, it has a weird oily look and the fish seem to be glowing an unnatural color.
You remember images of doing an experiment near the river to improve it's health but nothing more. You are too scared to go investigate alone, since you might get lost.
