Q: Hi
A: Hello there! Beautiful day, isn't it? Though, I have to say, the smell from the river is quite... unpleasant.
Time taken: 1.17 seconds

Q: My name is Tereza, who are you?
A: Nice to meet you, Tereza! I'm Bryn, the village's resident... well, I'm not quite sure what I am, but I like to think I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I've lived here in Elderbrook all my life, and I'm worried sick about our river.
Time taken: 2.82 seconds

Q: Bryn is a pretty name.
A: Thank you, Tereza! I've always been told it's a bit of an old-fashioned name, but I think it suits me just fine. It's a name that's been passed down through generations of Elderbrook villagers, and I'm proud to carry on that tradition.
Time taken: 2.28 seconds

Q: Where are you from Bryn?
A: Born and raised in Elderbrook, I am! This village has been my home for as long as I can remember, and I've always loved it here. There's something special about the way the sunlight filters through the meadows that surround us...
Time taken: 2.19 seconds

Q: How did you end up here?
A: Well, I used to be a scientist, or at least I think I was... my memories aren't quite as clear as I'd like them to be. I do know that I was working on a project to improve the health of our river, and something went terribly wrong.
Time taken: 2.44 seconds

Q: I heard you had an accident recently. What do you remember?
A: Yes... the accident. I'm afraid I don't remember much of it, to be honest. I do recall being near the river, but that's about it. Everything after that is a bit of a blur. It's funny, because it feels like just yesterday I was working on my project, and now... now I'm not even sure what I was working on.
Time taken: 3.25 seconds

Q: I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
A: Yes, that's true. It's not like the village is deserted or anything, but there are just fewer people out and about than usual. I think everyone's been affected by the river, to be honest. The fish are glowing, and the smell... well, it's just not right.
Time taken: 2.76 seconds

Q: I have noticed that the river stinks.
A: It's a terrible smell, isn't it? I've tried to stay away from it, but it's hard not to notice when it's like that. I just wish I could remember what caused it, but... (sigh)...that's just not something I can seem to recall.
Time taken: 2.78 seconds

Q: What do the other villagers think?
A: They're all a bit worried, to be honest. Old Amos and Greta are always fussing about something, and the Harts are trying to keep their farm running despite the pollution. Lila's been gathering herbs to try and find some sort of antidote, and Flynn's been working on fixing up the riverbank. It's just... everyone's on edge, waiting to see what's going to happen next.
Time taken: 3.87 seconds

Q: Is Ned worried about the river?
A: Ned's grumbling about it, as usual. He's always complaining about something, and the river's just another thing to grumble about. But, between you and me, Tereza, I think he's worried. He's just too proud to admit it.
Time taken: 3.01 seconds

Q: How about Jessica? Did you speak to her recently?
A: I think there's been a mistake, Tereza. I don't know anyone named Jessica in the village. I've spoken to everyone else, but not...
Time taken: 1.79 seconds

Q: Is there any way I could help you?
A: That's very kind of you, Tereza. To be honest, I'm not even sure where to start. I've been trying to piece together what happened to the river, but my memories are all a bit... fuzzy. If you could help me figure out what's going on, I'd be eternally grateful.
Time taken: 3.38 seconds

Q: Do you want to try to save the river with me?
A: That's a wonderful idea, Tereza! I would love to have someone to work with on this. I've been trying to come up with a plan, but it's hard to think straight when my memories are all jumbled. Together, maybe we can figure out what's going on and find a way to save the river.
Time taken: 3.73 seconds

Q: Do you know where the solar panels are?
A: The solar panels! I think I left something there, but... (pauses, looking puzzled) Wait, what was I going to remember? I'm afraid I've forgotten. But if you're willing to help me, we could definitely go check out the solar panels and see if anything sparks my memory.
Time taken: 3.61 seconds

Q: I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
A: That would be wonderful, Tereza! The solar panels are just on the edge of the village, aren't they? I'm sure I left something there that might help us figure out what's going on with the river. Lead the way, and let's go take a look!
