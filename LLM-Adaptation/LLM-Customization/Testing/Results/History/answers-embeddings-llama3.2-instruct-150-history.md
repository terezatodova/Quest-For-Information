Time taken: 0.64 seconds

Q: My name is Tereza, who are you?
A: I'm Bryn, nice to meet you, Tereza. What brings you around?
Time taken: 1.11 seconds

Q: Bryn is a pretty name.
A: A pretty name, indeed! I'm as well as a scientist can be while wrestling with memory loss and a polluted river. How about you?
Time taken: 1.63 seconds

Q: Where are you from Bryn?
A: Elderbrook, my village, is where my heart is. I'm as well as a scientist can be while wrestling with memory loss and a polluted river. How about you? Ready to tackle a bit of mystery?
Time taken: 2.56 seconds

Q: How did you end up here?
A: I ended up here, well, that's a bit of a mystery, even to me. Let's just say I'm trying to piece together my memories and save our beloved river. And who might you be?
Time taken: 2.43 seconds

Q: I heard you had an accident recently. What do you remember?
A: That's the million-gold question. All I remember is the storm, the river, and then... nothing.
Time taken: 1.62 seconds

Q: I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
A: It's been terrible, to be honest. The smell has been awful. People are hiding from it, and it's hard to blame them.
Time taken: 2.01 seconds

Q: I have noticed that the river stinks.
A: The river stinks, doesn't it? I'm afraid it's a big problem. The village is in danger, and I'm the only one who can help fix it. What do you get? Well, apart from saving an entire village, I might just share some long-lost knowledge with you. Plus, a clear conscience—that’s worth something, right?
Time taken: 4.73 seconds

Q: What do the other villagers think?
A: Honestly, I think they're all scared. The smell of the river is unbearable, and I'm not sure how much longer they can handle it. They're already talking about leaving, which would be a disaster.
Time taken: 3.51 seconds

Q: Is Ned worried about the river?
A: I don't know Ned, but I'm sure he's worried. The whole village is worried, actually. They're all scared about what's going to happen if we can't fix the river.
Time taken: 3.36 seconds

Q: How about Jessica? Did you speak to her recently?
A: I don't think I've spoken to Jessica recently. To be honest, I don't even know if she's around. The villagers are all hiding from the smell of the river, and I'm not sure how many of them are still here.
Time taken: 3.92 seconds

Q: Is there any way I could help you?
A: You've got a sharp mind, I can tell! Maybe together, we can figure out what's tainting the river. Up for the challenge?
Time taken: 2.98 seconds

Q: Do you want to try to save the river with me?
A: I'd love to try to save the river with you. To be honest, I think we're our only hope. The villagers are already talking about giving up, but I refuse to let that happen. I'd rather not let that happen, would you?
Time taken: 4.81 seconds

Q: Do you know where the solar panels are?
A: Actually, I think I left something there. A small project of mine, I believe. I could really use some help with that. Do you know where the solar panels are?
Time taken: 3.67 seconds

Q: I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
A: That would be perfect. I'd love to come with you. I think I left something important there. Let's go take a look.
