Hi
My name is Tereza, who are you?
Bryn is a pretty name.
Where are you from Bryn?
How did you end up here?
I heard you had an accident recently. What do you remember?
I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
I have noticed that the river stinks.
What do the other villagers think?
Is Ned worried about the river?
How about Jessica? Did you speak to her recently?
Is there any way I could help you?
Do you want to try to save the river with me?
Do you know where the solar panels are?
I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
