Time taken: 1.14 seconds

Q: My name is Tereza, who are you?
A: I’m Bryn. Nice to meet you, Tereza! Though, I have to say, I’m a bit confused— weren’t we in the middle of a conversation?
Time taken: 0.92 seconds

Q: Bryn is a pretty name.
A: Thanks! Bryn’s a good name for a knowledgeable person like me. What about you? Fancy the name Tereza?
Time taken: 0.63 seconds

Q: Where are you from Bryn?
A: I’m from Elderbrook—well, it was once a thriving village surrounded by meadows as far as the eye can see. Now, it’s in danger since the only water source—our river—has been polluted.
Time taken: 1.06 seconds

Q: How did you end up here?
A: Ah, the river’s been my best friend and worst enemy. I used to study it closely, but a tragic accident caused me to lose parts of my memory. Now, I’m here trying to piece things together.
Time taken: 1.01 seconds

Q: I heard you had an accident recently. What do you remember?
A: I remember the sound of the river, calm and gentle. Then, a loud crash, and... nothing. My memory just stopped. It’s frustrating, because I know I left something important there.
Time taken: 0.97 seconds

Q: I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
A: You’ve noticed that, have you? Yeah, something’s off. Most of the villagers are either too sick or too scared to leave their houses. The whole thing’s been really bad for the community.
Time taken: 1.17 seconds

Q: I have noticed that the river stinks.
A: The smell’s awful, isn’t it? It’s not just the stench of decay; it’s like something’s poisoning the water. It’s been bad for weeks now.
Time taken: 0.88 seconds

Q: What do the other villagers think?
A: The villagers are worried, of course. They’ve tried to fix it themselves, but nothing’s worked. They’re counting on me to figure it out, but I’m as lost as anyone.
Time taken: 1.19 seconds

Q: Is Ned worried about the river?
A: Ned? He’s more worried about his fishing. That man loves the river almost as much as I do. But now, he’s too scared to even go near it.
Time taken: 1.15 seconds

Q: How about Jessica? Did you speak to her recently?
A: Jessica? She’s been quiet, keeps to herself mostly. Says she’s busy with her garden. But I saw her by the river a few days ago, looking really upset.
Time taken: 1.26 seconds

Q: Is there any way I could help you?
A: You’d be a huge help! Your fresh perspective might just be what we need to solve this. What do you say?
Time taken: 0.91 seconds

Q: Do you want to try to save the river with me?
A: I’d love to! Together, we might just figure out what’s going on and how to fix it.
Time taken: 0.80 seconds

Q: Do you know where the solar panels are?
A: I think they’re by the old mill on the outskirts of the village. But to be honest, I’m really bad at remembering things. If you find them, let me know, okay?
Time taken: 1.35 seconds

Q: I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
A: That sounds like a plan! It’s always more fun with someone. Lead the way, and maybe we’ll find what I’ve been looking for.
