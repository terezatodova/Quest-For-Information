Time taken: 0.59 seconds

Q: Where are you from Bryn?
A: My village! It’s just over there *points*. We’re on the edge of a beautiful meadow, surrounded by nothing but nature.
Time taken: 0.64 seconds

Q: How did you end up here?
A: Oh, it’s a long story, Tereza! Let’s just say I was working on something important, and then... well, I think I might have gotten a bit too close to the edge of the world. Next thing I knew, I was here, in this lovely village!
Time taken: 1.30 seconds

Q: I heard you had an accident recently. What do you remember?
A: Accident? Oh dear, I don’t remember much of anything after that. Just bits and bobs. It’s all a bit of a fog, I’m afraid.
Time taken: 0.80 seconds

Q: I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
A: Yes, something is indeed amiss. The river next to our village has been polluted, and without it, our village is in danger. It’s a bit of a crisis, to be honest.

Q: I have noticed that the river stinks.
A: Ugh, isn’t it awful? It’s been like that for weeks now. The villagers are worried sick.
Time taken: 0.55 seconds

Q: What do the other villagers think?
A: Well, some are worried, others are worried more than others *laughs*. But everyone is on the lookout for a solution. We need someone to help us figure out what’s going on and how to fix it.

Q: How about Jessica? Did you speak to her recently?
A: Jessica! She’s always got a story to tell and a twinkle in her eye. I spoke to her just yesterday, actually. She’s been helping the villagers gather information about the river.

Q: Is there any way I could help you?
A: That’s very kind of you, Tereza! Actually, I could use someone to talk to. It’s not often I meet someone new around here. Would you like to chat?
Time taken: 0.88 seconds

Q: Do you want to try to save the river with me?
A: Oh, I’d love to! I know a thing or two about the river, and I could use someone to help me figure out what’s going on. Are you up for the challenge?
Time taken: 0.91 seconds

Q: Do you know where the solar panels are?
A: Solar panels? Hmm, I think I might have left something important there... *trails off* Oh, wait, no, I don’t want to talk about that. It’s not important. Let’s talk about saving the river instead!
Time taken: 1.15 seconds

Q: I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
A: Oh, would you? I’d love to! I think I might have left something... *gets up and starts walking with you* Oh, this is exciting! Maybe we’ll find something important!
