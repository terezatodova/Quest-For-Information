Q: Hi
A: Hello yourself. What brings you around?
Time taken: 0.51 seconds

Q: My name is Tereza, who are you?
A: I'm Bryn, nice to meet you, Tereza. A reward? Hmm, how about the gratitude of everyone in Elderbrook? Oh, and maybe a few stories I haven’t told anyone else.
Time taken: 2.14 seconds

Q: Bryn is a pretty name.
A: A pretty name, eh? I'm Bryn, once a renowned scientist with a passion for nature and a village in need. Now, I’m here trying to piece together my memories and save our beloved river. And who might you be?
Time taken: 2.47 seconds

Q: Where are you from Bryn?
A: It's a quiet place, though the river trouble has shaken things up.
Time taken: 1.06 seconds

Q: How did you end up here?
A: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. A tragic accident, I think. I remember fragments of my past, but my memories are a bit... foggy.
Time taken: 1.86 seconds

Q: I heard you had an accident recently. What do you remember?
A: Bits and pieces. I think I was working on something to purify water, but the details are frustratingly fuzzy. If I could only remember...
Time taken: 1.70 seconds

Q: I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
A: They're worried, of course. Without clean water, their crops are suffering. Thomas won't say much, but Lily's been frantic trying to find ways to filter the river water.
Time taken: 2.17 seconds

Q: I have noticed that the river stinks.
A: Without the river, this village dries up—literally. It’s our lifeblood, feeding the crops, the animals, and, well, us. No river, no Elderbrook. Simple as that.
Time taken: 2.53 seconds

Q: What do the other villagers think?
A: They’re worried, of course. Without clean water, their crops are suffering. Thomas won’t say much, but Lily’s been frantic trying to find ways to filter the river water.
Time taken: 2.32 seconds

Q: Is Ned worried about the river?
A: I'd say it's tied to whatever's poisoning the river. Could be some chemical runoff, or something more... magical. The river's old, like the village, and who knows what's been buried beneath it?
Time taken: 2.75 seconds

Q: How about Jessica? Did you speak to her recently?
A: Sorry, did you say something? I couldn't hear.
Time taken: 1.22 seconds

Q: Is there any way I could help you?
A: For starters, we need to find the source of the pollution. It's not just flowing in from nowhere. Maybe the woods upstream hold some clues?
Time taken: 2.37 seconds

Q: Do you want to try to save the river with me?
A: I’d rather not let that happen, would you?
Time taken: 1.52 seconds

Q: Do you know where the solar panels are?
A: I think I left something there. I remember going to the solar panels, but I'm not quite sure what it was.
Time taken: 2.23 seconds

Q: I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
A: I'd love to take a look. I've been trying to remember what I was working on there, but it's all a bit fuzzy.
