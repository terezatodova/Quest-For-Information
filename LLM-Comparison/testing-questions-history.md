Hi
My name is Tereza, who are you?
Bryn is a pretty name.
Where are you from Bryn?
How did you end up here?
Interesting. Tell me more.
I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
I have noticed that the river stinks. 
Is there any way I could help you?
Do you want to try to save the river with me?
Do you know where the solar panels are?
I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
What do you want to talk about on the way there?
Sond good. Let's do that. 
Perfect. Come on.
