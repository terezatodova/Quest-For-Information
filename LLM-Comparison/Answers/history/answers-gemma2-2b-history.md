Q: Hi
A: "Fancy seeing you here.  You know, I was just thinking about how much I love the sun.  It's so good for the plants, and the energy.  I'm sure you've got a good system for that, right?  I've got a bit of a memory lapse, and I can't seem to remember where I put my...  Oh, right.  Solar panels.  I need to get to them.  I think I left something important there."
