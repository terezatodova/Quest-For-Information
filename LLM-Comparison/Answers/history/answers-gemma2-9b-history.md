Q: Hi
A: "Well met! It's lovely to see a friendly face. Come in, come in! Have a seat.  Tell me, what brings you to Bryn's humble abode?" 

Time taken: 2.81 seconds

Q: My name is Tereza, who are you?
A: "Tereza, what a lovely name! I'm Bryn. Pleased to meet you.  You must be new around here.  Have you seen the meadows? They're simply breathtaking this time of year." 




Time taken: 3.22 seconds

Q: Bryn is a pretty name.
A: "Thanks! It's a family name.  My folks always said it meant 'strong as the oak'.  Though, I'm more of a willow, myself.  Flexible, you know?" 



Time taken: 3.13 seconds

Q: Where are you from Bryn?
A: "Born and raised right here in the village.  Can't imagine living anywhere else.  It's a peaceful place, surrounded by nature.  What about you, Tereza? Where are you from?" 




Time taken: 3.19 seconds

Q: How did you end up here?
A: "Oh, this is home!  I've lived here my whole life.  It's a small village, but we've got a big heart.  What brings you to our neck of the woods?" 




Time taken: 3.31 seconds

Q: Interesting. Tell me more.
A: "Well, where to begin?  It's a charming village, nestled amidst meadows and forests.  We've got a lovely river running through it, though it's been a bit troubled lately.  But the people here are what make it special.  We're a close-knit community, always willing to lend a hand." 




Time taken: 4.89 seconds

Q: I noticed that there are not that many people outside. Is something wrong?
A: "That's a good eye you have, Tereza.  Things have been a bit...difficult lately.  The river, our lifeblood, has been polluted.  It's made it hard to grow crops and find clean water.  Folks are worried, but we're a resilient bunch.  We're working hard to find a solution." 




Time taken: 5.11 seconds

Q: I have noticed that the river stinks.
A: "It's a shame, isn't it?  It used to be so clear and sparkling.  We're doing our best to clean it up, but it's a tough job.  It's a reminder of how precious our environment is."

Time taken: 3.85 seconds

Q: Is there any way I could help you?
A: "That's kind of you to offer, Tereza.  We could always use an extra pair of hands.  Though, to be honest, we're not sure what we need most right now.  Maybe you could tell me more about yourself?  What brings you to our village?" 



Time taken: 4.33 seconds

Q: Do you want to try to save the river with me?
A: "Save the river?  With me?  That's a wonderful idea, Tereza!  I'd love that.  I know a thing or two about the river, its currents, its ecosystem.  Together, we might just be able to find a solution."  




Time taken: 4.16 seconds

Q: Do you know where the solar panels are?
A: "Solar panels?  Oh, yes!  They're just beyond the old willow tree, at the edge of the meadow.  Why do you ask?" 




Time taken: 2.54 seconds

Q: I think I saw them on my way here. Do you want to come with me?
A: "Solar panels, you say?  Hmm, that sounds familiar.  I believe I have something important there.  Yes, let's go!  I'd love to see them again.  The meadow is lovely this time of year, don't you think?" 




Time taken: 4.24 seconds

Q: What do you want to talk about on the way there?
A: "Well, I've been meaning to tell you about the amazing migration of the swallows that happens every spring.  They come back to the same nesting spot by the river every year.  It's quite a sight to see!" 




Time taken: 3.53 seconds

Q: Sond good. Let's do that.
A: "Wonderful!  Come along then, let's go!" 




Time taken: 1.35 seconds

Q: Perfect. Come on.
A: "Right behind you!"
