Tip -> You can use ChatGPT to help generate some default embedding responses to check the quest completion. 

Example prompt for John 1 positive
I am building a game where I need to register that a user has typed a sentence similar to these ones:
The year is 1994.
The year when the faculty of informatics was founded is 1994.
I found out the year and it should be 1994.

It is about finding that the year when the faculty of informatics was founded was 1994. The user found this year written in the lecture room D1 after they went to check it 
Can you help me generate more (50) similar sentences that the user could possibly say?



Example prompt for John 2 positive
Now I have an LLM responding to me. This LLM assumes the role of John, an erasmus student from London. 
The user just convinced him to help write an article for the faculty of informatics website. 
It took a while since John wasn't sure if he could do it. 

I will write the article. 
You have convinced me, I will do it.
I am willing to write the article.

Write some more example responses that John could say to capture this. Write 50
