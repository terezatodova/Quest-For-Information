How to run the app using docker-compose:

    Make sure that docker desktop is running.
    Run command: 
        docker-compose up --build -d

This app will expose PC port 5000 to traffic on local network. 
Make sure your machine is accessible on the local network and that firewall rules allow access on port 5000.

The application will be accessible at 
http://localhost:5000 -> When accessing the server from the same device
http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:5000 -> When accessing the server from another device on the same network

Replace xxx.xxx.x.xxx with your local IP. 
You can find that out by running
- ipconfig on Windows
- ifconfig, or ip a on Linux/macOS


How to allow access on port 5000 through firewall? 
(Generated by ChatGPT, tested out)

For Windows, follow these steps:
Open the Firewall:
    Search for "Windows Defender Firewall" in the Start menu.
    Click on "Advanced Settings" on the left panel.
Create a new inbound rule:
    In the "Advanced Security" window, click on "Inbound Rules" in the left-hand sidebar.
    On the right-hand side, click "New Rule...".
    Select "Port" and click "Next".
    Choose "TCP" and specify port 5000, then click "Next".
    Select "Allow the connection", then click "Next".
    Choose when the rule applies (for example, Domain, Private, Public), and click "Next".
    Name the rule (e.g., "Allow Flask Port 5000") and click "Finish".
Test the setup by accessing the Flask app from another device on the same network using the machine's IP (e.g., http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:5000)
    Note: This can be done only after actually running the server

The applicatiOn is intended to run on GPU. 
Make sure that your laptop has an NVIDIA GPU and that your GPU supports CUDA.
Needs a functioning nvidia toolkit - run nvidia-smi to verify. 
If you are on windows you also need to have wls installed and enabled in docker desktop -> https://docs.docker.com/desktop/gpu/
(Also don't forget to run run wsl --update if necessary)
