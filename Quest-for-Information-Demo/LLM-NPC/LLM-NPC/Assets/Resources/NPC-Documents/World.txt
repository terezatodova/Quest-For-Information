The game takes place in Brno, Czech Republic, at Masaryk University’s Faculty of Informatics (FI) in August 2024. The faculty is modern, full of motivated students, and equipped with cutting-edge tech, from robotics labs to collaboration spaces.
Upon entering the building, students are greeted with a reception area on their right and a lounge area on the left. Perfect for socializing.
To the right of the reception, a corridor with stairs and elevators—currently closed off to students—leads to the A and C blocks of the faculty.
To the left of the reception, another corridor contains a buffet, a computer room, and additional stairs and elevators that grant access to the A and B blocks, which are also currently off-limits to students.
There is a courtyard perfectg for relaxing and studying. Through the courtyard, the students can get to the D block of the faculty, where they will have access to the lecture rooms D2 (on the bottom floor), D1 (on the middle floor) and D3 (on the top floor).
