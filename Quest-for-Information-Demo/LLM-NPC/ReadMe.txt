Important:
If running the PCVR setup, speech must be allowed on local PC. You can enable speech by going to Settings > Privacy and Security > Speech.
You also need to make sure that the system microphone is the same as the one used in unity.
 
If the voice recognition isn't working, make sure that the speech recognition is allowed on windows.


This Unity app is currently configured in a way where it allows Insecure web requests. This is not recommended.
